Today I found out my `box-decoration-break` was broken.

**The issue**: I just made a fancy blog post title with padding and some background color, as I'm stylish 😎
All sleek, until too long - wrapping on multiple lines makes me think twice about "stylish":

<CodePen slug="emzOpMM" user="codenomnom" />

My artish (half-dead) persona can't handle such an ugliness! So AI to the rescue (don't tell anyone).
Turns out `box-decoration-break` has been around since Gangnam Style was #1 on the carts
(I found this through AI as well, but I remember that shady period of my life):

```css
.definitely-not-crying {
  display: inline;
  background: white;
  padding: 4px 8px; /* yes, this was the culprit of it all */
  box-decoration-break: clone; /* been here since forever */
  -webkit-box-decoration-break: clone; /* Safari tax */
}
```

Each line gets its own box now. Like separate pieces. Revolutionary stuff, right?
Besides paddings I think shadow is the next biggest win for such usage.

Won't bother you with more - just go read the beloved [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/box-decoration-break).

I'll need to search all old references for "experienced in CSS" and update those, right? 🧐

p.s.
I found people fixing this with an extremely shady [SVG tricks](https://codepen.io/smlsvnssn/pen/ZEbBJPR), maybe I should call them?
