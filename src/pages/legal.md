The design very loosely based upon [Astro Cactus](https://github.com/chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus/) theme, which was inspired by the [Hexo Cactus](https://github.com/probberechts/hexo-theme-cactus) theme. No <a href="https://www.grammarbook.com/blog/singular-vs-plural/plural-cactus-cacti-cactuses/" target="_blank">cacti</a> around though.

## Terms & Conditions
Not sure what to put here - feel free to go wild :)
