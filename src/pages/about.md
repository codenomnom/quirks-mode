# about

I hate the "what do you do" question. Because "software development" sounds like sending people to Mars and solving complex world problems.
Matrix like code rainfall and groundbreaking innovations.

Baby, we're writing `padding-top: 50%` to make squares in 2025. We're fighting CSS units like it's the Cold War!
Most of us learned about `:target` last year, despite being available since Google was founded.
React hooks supposedly fixed everything but we're still debugging stale closures at 11 PM on a Tuesday, and no,
we don't have beers and chips anymore, we're damn old for that crap!

I've been doing this for way too long to pretend the web is a reasonable place.

But then there's this _weird beauty_ that some of us find int it. This chaos demands creativity - nothing's ever as simple as it seems.
It's challenging, unpredictable and somehow, against all logic, _oddly fun_.
The web is held together with duct tape and gnarly hacks older than the millennials.
And I choose to cherish it!

This is a _manifest_ of all the battles with the quirks and whimsy _peculiarities_ of web development.
Short posts about the bizarre, counterintuitive, deeply stupid things that make front-end development feel like performance art designed by people who hate you personally.

## the name

Not sure what the name means? Dang, you missed such a jolly period!

Back in the days, some smart HTML standards arrived, but they were more like "suggestions" and every browser just... did whatever.
Chaos. Tears. Developers weeping into their keyboards.

Enter `quirks-mode` - a special rendering mode that went "okay, fine, we'll render your garbage website _exactly_ how IE5 would have".
It's backward compatibility as an act of mercy. Or madness? Hard to say.

It's like keeping a dusty old cassette player around to play those classic mixtapes.
Sure, the sound quality isn't great, but at least the tunes still play!

And the thing is... we never truly left that mode. 20+ years later we're just in a different type of swamp. Welcome to the circus.

## handshake

Sounds fun, having a _coding tantrum_ or you're simply proud of that shaky workaround?
Attaboy!
