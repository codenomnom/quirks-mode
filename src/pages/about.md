# about

I often find myself stumped with the _"what do you do"_ question.
I'm wondering if people imagine it as a groundbreaking, Matrix-like work.
Changing the world, sending people to Mars.

Most of the time? A good few hours knee-deep in a UTC fight with a JS Date.
Just so I compare two of those. Or why an image is mysteriously shifted by a few stubborn pixels.
It's always `!important`

But there's a weird beauty in it. This chaos demands creativity - nothing's ever as simple as it seems.
It's challenging, unpredictable, and oddly fun. I choose to cherrish it.

## handshake

Sounds fun, having a _coding tantrum_ or you're simply proud of that shaky workaround?
Attaboy!  <a href="https://mailhide.io/e/1FJhhQmU" onclick="popup=window.open('https://mailhide.io/e/1FJhhQmU','mailhidepopup','width=580,height=635'); return false;">Drop me a line</a>.

## the name

Not sure what `quirks-mode` means? You lucky lad, I almost hate you!

Back in the days, HTML standards were more of a _guidelines_ and each browser had its own interpretation on how the web worked.
Chaos reigned. Developers cried.

Enter `quirks-mode`! It's like the web's version of a secret handshake for outdated code.
It allowed browsers to render older pages with all their glorious, quirky inconsistencies from the pre-standards era,
making sure those sites didn't crumble while the rest of the web moved on.

It's like keeping a dusty old cassette player around to play those classic mixtapes.
Sure, the sound quality isn't great, but at least the tunes still play!
